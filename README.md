# Luke Barrington's blog

This is my personal blog where I sporadically write about issues relating to tech, startups, product management, video games or whatever is on my mind. 
The blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the lovely [BlackDoc](http://karloespiritu.com/blackdoc/) theme and is hosted on github pages.
All thoughts are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my employer, spouse, family or band.
