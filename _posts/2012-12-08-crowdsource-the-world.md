Recently I had the great pleasure to speak at TEDx SMU, one of the original TEDx events. 
Sharing the stage with the likes of undersea explorer [David Gallo](https://www.ted.com/speakers/david_gallo), ground-breaking journalist [Molly Bingham](http://www.meetmollybingham.com/) and spectacular cinematographer [Louie Schwartzberg](https://www.ted.com/speakers/louie_schwartzberg) was a humbling honor. 
Even more amazing, I got to share my thoughts with a packed house about crowdsourcing, digital activism and get some help in my search for silver sneakers!

I look forward to speaking at more inspirational events like this and spreading the word about how technology can change the world[^1]. 

[^1]: On the topic of using technology to change the world, shout out to Christian Genco who spoke right before me on why [you should learn to program](http://christian.gen.co/you-should-learn-to-program)!
