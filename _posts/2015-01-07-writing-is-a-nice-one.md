New year, new resolutions, new ideas... but the same old procrastination.
Among the many "best of", "new ideas" and "top X things about Y" emails we all got as we crossed the checkpoint between last year and this year, one slapped me in the face. 
[Make 2015 the year you get started writing](https://medium.com/medium-writing-prompts/what-prepares-you-for-the-day-569939b9525e)<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>.

I've had [blogs](http://doubtfulsound.blogspot.ie/), I have a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/lukeinusa) and I write a ton of emails but, with the days of writing college papers and school essays long behind me, I don't really *write* much anymore.

Well, this blog hopes to change all that. 
I'm not sure yet what I'll write about. 
I have lots to share about the technical trivia of writing code and building websites. 
I love war stories and motivational messages from the startup scene. 
I'm more and more exctied about product managment and how good product strategy can build business and innovate the tools we love to work with and the toys we love to play with.
And, of course, I love good writing, interesting thoughts and using the interwebs to share ideas.

So bring it on 2015. Let's write.

<a name="footnote-2"></a>2. Yes, I'm aware of the irony in proclaiming my love for good writing using a sentence that starts with a preposition. But this is my first time wtiting in a while (see, I did it again).</>
