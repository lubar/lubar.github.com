Five years ago, the idea of [Tomnod](http://tomnod.com) was born on the remote plains of Mongolia (in case you didn't know, ["*Tomnod*" means "*Big Eye*" in Mongolian](http://blog.tomnod.com/meaning-of-tomnod/)).
Since then, millions of people have joined our thousands of campaigns and helped us explore every corner of the planet.

This week, I was honored to be invited to speak at [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.us/), a global network of app developers, hackers and entrepreneurs. 
As part of a DigitalGlobe session on Location + Mobile, I shared some of the adventures that I've taken with Tomnod.
I start with our quest to search for the tomb of Genghis Khan, then share some tips about starting a company and finally describe how things really took off once we joined DigitalGlobe!

Tomnod is all about exploration, community and adventure. 
More adventures to come!
