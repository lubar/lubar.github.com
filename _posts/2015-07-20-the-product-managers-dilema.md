In the past few years, I've been on an entrepreneurial and professional journey. I started as a technologist, with a PhD in computer engineering and a deep connection with algorithms, machine learning and deriving everything from first principles. 
Taking these ideas and putting them online for the world to see and play with taught me to become a coder and I immersed myself in web programming, databases and whole lot of [StackOverflow]('http://stackoverflow.com/users/212602/lubar'). 
The final step in this evolution has been to take ideas, implemented in software and try to match them up with actual needs of real -- hopefully paying -- users in the marketplace.

This intersection of technology, design and market has led me to my current career as a Product Manager. 
Some people call Product Managers a "mini-CEO" since you own all aspects of the product and, ultimately, the buck stops with you. 
However, there's one big difference between a product manager and a CEO: although you have all the responsibility, **no one actually works for you**!

This is what I call the *Product Manager's Dilema*.
The PM holds the product vision, owns the customer requirements, sets pricing and is responsible for the deadlines and successful introduction of the next big thing that the company is banking on.
But they take all this on without having direct control over Engineering or ownership of the Sales and Marketing functions. 
So what does it take to be a successful product manager?

Instead, the Product Manager must succeed through influence
